# Wallet Options

Choose ONE for the demo:
1) **Microsoft Entra Verified ID**: issue/verify VCs; anchor credential hash to EVM chain using `issuer-tools/`.
2) **Aries/Indy (Trinsic, Lissi, etc.)**: mobile agent issues/holds/presents VCs; add an "anchor to EVM" step.
3) **SD-JWT** wallet (web demo): implement minimal holder with passkey and SD-JWT support.

## Passkeys
Use **WebAuthn** for local authentication to RPs (Bank A/B/Fintech) along with VC presentations.
